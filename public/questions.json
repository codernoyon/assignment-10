      "question": "Differente between authorization and authentication ?",
      "answer": "Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource. Authentication is the act of validating that users are whom they claim to be. This is the first step in any security process. In some instances, systems require the successful verification of more than one factor before granting access. Authorization in system security is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function. This term is often used interchangeably with access control or client privilege."

      "question": "Why are you use firebase? What other option do you have to implement authentication?",
      "answer": "Google's Firebase is a mobile platform that lets us develop mobile apps. It is especially geared towards business apps, with the intention of helping businesses grow their user bases and increase their profits through their mobile apps. The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience. There is a growing demand for different types of user authentication technologies for both online and in physical systems. The motivation to authenticate users ranges from access control reasons to business development purposes like adding e-commerce elements."
